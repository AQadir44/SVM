# SVM

“Support Vector Machine” (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges. However, it is mostly used in classification problems.

### CODE: 
1. Apply SVM algorithm to the iris data and got 98% accuracy (iris dataset.ipynb)
2. Apply SVM algorithm to the breast cancer dataset and got 96% accuracy (SVM.ipynb).
